Milo Project Documentation!
===================================

**Milo** is a social network with feature-sets for posts, scheduling events,
broadcasting promotions - all location-based, so you only get what truly matters. 
 There is something for everyone! We aim to solve the problem of social reach for the users where they have the control.
  In-line with the agenda, Milo offers a lot with endless applications!

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
how to :ref:`installation` the project.
