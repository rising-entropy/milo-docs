Milo Project Documentation!
===================================

**Milo** is a social network with feature-sets for posts, scheduling events, broadcasting promotions - all location-based, so you only get what truly matters. There is something for everyone! We aim to solve the problem of social reach for the users where they have the control. In-line with the agenda, Milo offers a lot with endless applications!



**Lumache** (/lu'make/) is a Python library for cooks and food lovers
that creates recipes mixing random ingredients.
It pulls data from the `Open Food Facts database <https://world.openfoodfacts.org/>`_
and offers a *simple* and *intuitive* API.

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
how to :ref:`installation` the project.
